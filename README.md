# ZetaÎ¶

In context, it's an RL Agents party. We have implemented plenty of RL agents that work on Typhoon, our physics engine, and OpenAI Gym to perform some tasks. From playing strategic games that we have made (like connect4, chess, and XO) to moving body parts of different designs (like ants, humans, and spiders) that were made on our engine, our agents were capable of fulfilling their tasks successfully.
